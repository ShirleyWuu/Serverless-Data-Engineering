# Serverless-Data-Engineering

### DEMO VIDEO

### Introduction
To build a serverless data engineering project. Serverless means that I could just focus on the 'Function' and 'Data', without thinking about the server. This project could use to analyze the sentiment and translate the phrase from English to another language(E.g: Spanish).

#### TOOLS
Not yet finish.

#### WEEKLY PROCESS
- week 1: Create Lambda function <br>
Step functions are to orchestrates phase that entering and until accept the phrase from somebody next. Then take the output of that after I do some things to it and then I will perform sentiment analysis translated and then finally, figure out in a third function .
